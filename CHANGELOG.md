# Changelog

## 3.2.0

### Features

-[#408](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/408) Provides a polyfill for IE 11+

-[#410](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/410) Add `token.isLoginRedirect` function to prevent app from starting new Oauth flow while already in OAuth callback state.

## 3.1.4

### Bug Fixes

- [#400](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/400) Allows an accessToken to be retrieved without an idToken. Also allows retrieving "default" scopes as defined by the custom authorization server.

- [#402](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/402) Fixes tokenManager cookie storage size limitation issue by store tokens in separated cookies.

## 3.1.3

### Bug Fixes

- [#395](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/395) Prevents concurrent use of token API methods such as `getWithoutPrompt`, `getWithRedirect` or `getWithPopup` within a single running instance. These methods will be executed within a queue to ensure that they complete sequentially. This fix only affects a single instance. If there are several instances running (for example, in multiple tabs) it is still possible for token API methods to be executing concurrently.

- [#399](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/399) Fixes an error involving PKCE flow and the signin widget.

## 3.1.2

- [#384](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/384) Shifts browser storage for ephemeral PKCE code challenge to default to sessionStorage before localStorage or cookies.
  - This should reduce problems with multiple tabs making overlapping requests to renew tokens.
- [#386](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/386) Fixes `token.verify`: `validationParams` should be optional.

## 3.1.1

### Bug Fixes

- [#369](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/369)
  - Will reject with error if PKCE is enabled but not supported when OIDC flow is initiated. Previously this check was done in the constructor and affected non-OIDC flows

  - Will print a console warning and disable secure cookies if cookies.secure is enabled on an HTTP connection. Previously this would throw in the constructor.

## 3.1.0

### Features

- [#363](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/363) 
  - Expose server bundle for React Native platform as an Authentication SDK.
  - Handle userAgent customization with newly added userAgent field in config.

## 3.0.1

### Bug Fixes

- [#354](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/354) - Omit cookies from API requests. Removes warning messages in latest version of Chrome.

- [#355](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/355) - Fix for authorization_code flow for non-SPA applications (when responseType=code and pkce=false). The code can be retrieved client-side using `parseFromUrl()` without throwing an error.

## 3.0.0

### Features

New [option](README.md#additional-options) `cookies` allows overriding default `secure` and `sameSite` values.

### Breaking Changes

- [#308](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/308) - Removed `jquery` and `reqwest` httpRequesters

- [#309](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/309) - Removed `Q` library, now using standard Promise. IE11 will require a polyfill for the `Promise` object. Use of `Promise.prototype.finally` requires Node > 10.3 for server-side use.

- [#310](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/310) - New behavior for [signOut()](README.md#signout)
  - `postLogoutRedirectUri` will default to `window.location.origin`
  - [signOut()](README.md#signout) will revoke access token and perform redirect by default. Fallback to XHR [closeSession()](README.md#closesession) if no idToken.
  - New method [closeSession()](README.md#closesession) for XHR signout without redirect or reload.
  - New method [revokeAccessToken()](README.md#revokeaccesstokenaccesstoken)

- [#311](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/311) - [parseFromUrl()](README.md#tokenparsefromurloptions) now returns tokens in an object hash (instead of array). The `state` parameter (passed to authorize request) is also returned.

- [#313](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/313) - An HTTPS origin will be enforced unless running on `http://localhost` or `cookies.secure` is set to `false`

- [#316](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/316) - Option `issuer` is [required](README.md#configuration-reference). Option `url` has been deprecated and is no longer used.

- [#317](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/317) - `pkce` [option](README.md#additional-options)  is now `true` by default. `grantType` option is removed.

- [#320](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/320) - `getWithRedirect`, `getWithPopup`, and `getWithoutPrompt` previously took 2 sets of option objects as parameters, a set of "oauthOptions" and additional options. These methods now take a single options object which can hold all [available options](README.md#authorize-options). Passing a second options object will cause an exception to be thrown.

- [#321](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/321)
  - Default responseType when using [implicit flow](README.md#implicit-oauth-20-flow) is now `['token', 'id_token']`.
  - When both access token and id token are returned, the id token's `at_hash` claim will be validated against the access token

- [#325](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/325) - Previously, the default `responseMode` for [PKCE](README.md#pkce-oauth-20-flow) was `"fragment"`. It is now `"query"`. Unless explicitly specified using the `responseMode` option, the `response_mode` parameter is no longer passed by `token.getWithRedirect` to the `/authorize` endpoint. The `response_mode` will be set by the backend according to the [OpenID specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Authentication). [Implicit flow](README.md#implicit-oauth-20-flow) will use `"fragment"` and [PKCE](README.md#pkce-oauth-20-flow) will use `"query"`. If previous behavior is desired, [PKCE](README.md#pkce-oauth-20-flow) can set the `responseMode` option to `"fragment"`.

- [#329](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/329) - Fix internal fetch implementation. `responseText` will always be a string, regardless of headers or response type. If a JSON object was returned, the object will be returned as `responseJSON` and `responseType` will be set to "json". Invalid/malformed JSON server response will no longer throw a raw TypeError but will return a well structured error response which includes the `status` code returned from the server.

### Other

- [#306](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/306) - Now using babel for ES5 compatibility. [All polyfills have been removed](README.md#browser-compatibility).

- [#312](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/312) - Added an E2E test for server-side authentication (node module, not webpack).

## 2.13.2

### Bug Fixes

-[#338](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/pull/338) - (Fix for Chrome 80) Setting 'Secure' on cookies if running on HTTPS. Setting 'SameSite=Lax' on cookies if running on HTTP. TokenManager (if using cookie storage) will retain previous behavior, setting 'SameSite=Lax' in all cases unless `tokenManager.secure` is set to `true` via config.

## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Token retrieval is now asyncronous to account for automatic token renewal.

  ```javascript
  // ES2016+
  const accessToken = await authClient.tokenManager.get('accessToken');

  // Handle as a promise
  authClient.tokenManager.get('accessToken')
  .then(function(accessToken) {
    console.log(accessToken);
  });
  ```

* Removed the following deprecated methods:
  * `idToken.authorize`
  * `idToken.verify`
  * `idToken.refresh`
  * `idToken.decode`

### Features

* Clears whitespace around URLs when instantiating the client.
* Infer the `url` from the `issuer` to simplify client setup.

### Other

* Renames all `refresh` methods on the `token` and `tokenManager` objects to `renew`.
