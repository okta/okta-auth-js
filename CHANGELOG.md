## 2.0.1

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an problem, introduced in 2.0.0, that was causing tokens to be refreshed every time `authClient.tokenManager.get('accessToken')` was called.

## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Token retrieval is now asyncronous to account for automatic token renewal.

  ```javascript
  // ES2016+
  const accessToken = await authClient.tokenManager.get('accessToken');

  // Handle as a promise
  authClient.tokenManager.get('accessToken')
  .then(function(accessToken) {
    console.log(accessToken);
  });
  ```

* Removed the following deprecated methods:
  * `idToken.authorize`
  * `idToken.verify`
  * `idToken.refresh`
  * `idToken.decode`

### Features

* Clears whitespace around URLs when instantiating the client.
* Infer the `url` from the `issuer` to simplify client setup.

### Other

* Renames all `refresh` methods on the `token` and `tokenManager` objects to `renew`.
